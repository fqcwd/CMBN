# CMBN
The samples of CMBN datasets come from NWAFU-Cattle (https://github.com/MicaleLee/
Database) and Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/twisdu/dairy-cow), and we provide more annotations of individuals.

Our annotated datasets have been shared on baidudisk (https://pan.baidu.com/s/145QJMChxf0iq7P329juYEw code:z3ve).
